class PIIAnonymizer:
    """Handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information) removal and anonymization from resume content.
    
    This class provides comprehensive functionality to identify and anonymize various types of
    personally identifiable information commonly found in resumes and job-related documents.
    The anonymization process helps protect candidate privacy while preserving the document
    structure and professional content for analysis.
    
    Supported PII types include:
    - Email addresses
    - Phone numbers (various formats including US and international)
    - Physical addresses (street addresses and city/state/zip combinations)
    - Personal websites and portfolios (with option to preserve professional domains)
    - Candidate names (typically found at the top of resumes)
    
    The class uses configurable patterns and settings loaded from the application configuration
    to customize the anonymization behavior. All anonymization operations are logged for 
    audit and debugging purposes.
    
    Attributes:
        config (ConfigLoader): Configuration loader instance for accessing anonymization settings
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger instance for tracking anonymization operations and results
    
    Example:
        >>> anonymizer = PIIAnonymizer()
        >>> content = "John Doe\\nSoftware Engineer\\njohn.doe@email.com\\n(555) 123-4567"
        >>> anonymized = anonymizer.anonymize_resume(content)
        >>> print(anonymized)
        [NAME_REDACTED]
        Software Engineer
        [EMAIL_REDACTED]
        [PHONE_REDACTED]
    
    Note:
        The anonymization process is designed to be conservative, preferring to redact
        information that might be PII rather than risk exposing actual personal data.
        Configuration settings allow fine-tuning of the anonymization behavior.
