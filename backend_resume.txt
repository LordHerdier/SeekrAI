## Summary  
A mid-level backend DevOps engineer with, like, 4+ years of wrestling cloud infra and pipelines into submission. Obsessed with automating the heck out of everything so I can drink more coffee and debug less. Secretly convinced servers have feelings‚Äîmostly betrayed ones‚Äîbut I keep ‚Äòem happy (most of the time).
